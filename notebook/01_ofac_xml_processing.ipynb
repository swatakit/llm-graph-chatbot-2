      "The OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) database is a critical tool used for compliance and due diligence checks, particularly in the context of financial transactions and international business operations. It contains information about individuals and entities that are subject to sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. Here's an overview of the data and insights into its potential use:\n",

      "### Overview of OFAC Data\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Entities and Types**:\n",
      "   - The database includes a total of 17,584 entries, comprising both individuals and entities.\n",
      "   - There are 7,354 individuals and 10,230 entities, which are further categorized into specific types such as vessels and aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Country Distribution**:\n",
      "   - The top five countries with the most entries are Russia (5,796), Mexico (1,888), Iran (1,808), China (1,081), and Syria (823). This indicates a significant focus on these regions, likely due to geopolitical tensions or specific sanction programs targeting these countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sanction Program Distribution**:\n",
      "   - The most prevalent sanction programs include RUSSIA-EO14024 (6,402 entries), SDGT (Specially Designated Global Terrorist, 2,641 entries), SDNTK (Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficking Kingpin, 1,423 entries), IFSR (Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations, 1,259 entries), and NPWMD (Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, 992 entries). This highlights the U.S. government's focus on countering terrorism, drug trafficking, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n",
